- The Koza Strongly-Typed flavoured build methods have been simplified and optimized (around 10 times faster for a code length reduced by five!) 

- It is now possible to use a specific function-terminal sets for each of the children node. And these children node are built in the order they appear in the tree constraints (this feature only existed for ADF in the previous version). This makes pySTEP very competitive and gives it a serious advantage over existing Strongly typed GP packages :) 

- It is now possible to specify what happens after the system has tried 100 times to produced rules-compliant offsprings using crossover but has failed (this might happens if we use a lot of constraining rules). Either we accept the unfit offsprings with Substitute_Mutation=0 or we substitute them with a mutated tree by setting Substitute_Mutation=1.

- The parameters of the tournament selection are integrated in the main function that calls the evolutionary run. 

- Code for crossover and mutation is now simplified and clearer. 

- Changed the comments on the code to comply with the new documentation.

- Also changed the default path of the database to     dbname=r'C:\pop_db'
